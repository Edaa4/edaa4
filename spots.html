    <h2>Here are some of my favorite spots!</h2>

    <h3>Soho Cafe & Grill:</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite places to eat! I always get the same order from here. Which is the tofu scramble. They actually took it off of the menu, but because I'm a regular, they know what I mean when I ask for it. It makes me feel pretty special!!</p>
    <p>The tofu scramble consists of tofu&#40;duh&#41;, kale, quinoa, avocado, tomato, and a bit of vegan cheese. It's soo yummy, and I'll usually get a cookie for dessert.</p>

    <h3>Greenwood Cemetery:</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite places to just hang out. I don't like going to the park that much, it's always a bit too crowded and loud for me, so Greenwood cemetery is perfect. It has beautiful scenery and its very quiet and calm.</p>
    <p>It's always important to make sure to respect the non living, though. Make sure to follow all the rules carefully!</p>
